# Tardy #

*The application for doing later what you could do today.*

Tardy is a tongue-in-cheek application with no real purpose beyond serving as a learning exercise.  The motivation for this work comes from the opportunity of reviewing the Rust Book Chapter 17 on async programming.  In an effort to "give a proper review", I am testing the principles laid out in the chapter to see if I can exercise any new muscles.
